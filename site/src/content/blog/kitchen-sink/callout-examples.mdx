This subpost provides a complete reference for all callout variants with practical examples and use cases for each one.

## General Purpose Callouts

These are the most commonly used callout variants for general content:

### Note

<Callout variant="note">
  **Default variant** - When no variant is specified, this is what you get. Perfect for supplementary information that enhances the main content.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="note" title="Custom Title Example">
  You can add a custom title to any callout variant. This helps provide context for the note content.
</Callout>

### Tip

<Callout variant="tip">
  Use the tip variant for helpful suggestions, best practices, or time-saving shortcuts that readers will appreciate.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip" title="Keyboard Shortcut">
  Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (Windows) to quickly open the search dialog in most modern applications.
</Callout>

### Warning

<Callout variant="warning">
  The warning variant alerts users to potential issues or things they should be careful about. Use it for non-critical concerns.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Deprecation Notice">
  The `oldMethod()` function will be deprecated in v3.0. Please migrate to `newMethod()` to ensure compatibility with future versions.
  
  ```js
  // Old way (deprecated)
  api.oldMethod(data);
  
  // New way (recommended)
  api.newMethod(data);
  ```
</Callout>

### Danger

<Callout variant="danger">
  Reserve the danger variant for critical warnings about destructive operations, security risks, or irreversible actions.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="danger" title="Irreversible Action">
  **This will permanently delete your database!**
  
  Once executed, this action cannot be undone. Make sure you have:
  - ✅ Created a recent backup
  - ✅ Verified the backup is restorable
  - ✅ Confirmed this is the intended action
</Callout>

### Important

<Callout variant="important">
  The important variant highlights critical information that users must understand or act upon.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="important" title="Required Configuration">
  You must set these environment variables before running the application:
  
  ```bash
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db
  API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
  NODE_ENV=production
  ```
  
  Without these variables, the application will fail to start.
</Callout>

## Academic and Mathematical Callouts

These variants are designed for educational content, documentation, and technical writing:

### Definition

<Callout variant="definition">
  A **binary search tree** (BST) is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and right child.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="definition" title="Big O Notation">
  **Big O notation** describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity in the worst-case scenario. For example:
  - O(1) - Constant time
  - O(log n) - Logarithmic time
  - O(n) - Linear time
  - O(n²) - Quadratic time
</Callout>

### Theorem

<Callout variant="theorem" title="Pythagorean Theorem">
  In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) equals the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).
  
  $$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$
</Callout>

<Callout variant="theorem" title="Central Limit Theorem">
  Given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with finite variance, the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the population's distribution.
  
  <Callout variant="proof">
    Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be independent random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Define:
    
    $$Z_n = \frac{\sqrt{n}(\bar{X}_n - \mu)}{\sigma}$$
    
    Then as $n \to \infty$, $Z_n$ converges in distribution to $N(0, 1)$.
  </Callout>
</Callout>

### Lemma

<Callout variant="lemma">
  If a function $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, then there exists at least one $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="lemma" title="Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages">
  For any regular language $L$, there exists a constant $p$ (pumping length) such that any string $w \in L$ with $|w| \geq p$ can be divided into three parts $w = xyz$ satisfying:
  1. $|y| > 0$
  2. $|xy| \leq p$
  3. For all $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in L$
</Callout>

### Proof

<Callout variant="proof">
  We'll prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational by contradiction.
  
  Assume $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\gcd(p, q) = 1$.
  
  Then $2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$, so $p^2 = 2q^2$.
  
  This means $p^2$ is even, therefore $p$ is even. Let $p = 2k$.
  
  Substituting: $(2k)^2 = 2q^2 \Rightarrow 4k^2 = 2q^2 \Rightarrow 2k^2 = q^2$
  
  So $q^2$ is even, therefore $q$ is even.
  
  But if both $p$ and $q$ are even, then $\gcd(p, q) \geq 2$, contradicting our assumption. □
</Callout>

### Corollary

<Callout variant="corollary">
  Since every differentiable function is continuous, any function that is differentiable on $[a, b]$ satisfies the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="corollary" title="From Fermat's Little Theorem">
  If $p$ is prime and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
  
  **Corollary**: For any integer $a$ and prime $p$, we have $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$.
</Callout>

### Proposition

<Callout variant="proposition">
  Every finite group of prime order is cyclic.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="proposition" title="Properties of Determinants">
  For any $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$:
  1. $\det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)$
  2. $\det(A^T) = \det(A)$
  3. If $A$ is invertible, $\det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)}$
</Callout>

### Axiom

<Callout variant="axiom">
  **Axiom of Choice**: For any collection of non-empty sets, there exists a choice function that selects one element from each set.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="axiom" title="Peano Axioms">
  The natural numbers are defined by:
  1. 0 is a natural number
  2. Every natural number has a successor
  3. 0 is not the successor of any natural number
  4. Different natural numbers have different successors
  5. (Induction) If a property holds for 0 and holds for n+1 whenever it holds for n, then it holds for all natural numbers
</Callout>

### Conjecture

<Callout variant="conjecture">
  **P vs NP**: It is conjectured that P ≠ NP, meaning there exist problems whose solutions can be verified quickly but cannot be found quickly.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="conjecture" title="Collatz Conjecture">
  For any positive integer $n$, repeatedly apply:
  - If $n$ is even: $n \to n/2$
  - If $n$ is odd: $n \to 3n + 1$
  
  The conjecture states that this process always reaches 1.
  
  <Callout variant="example">
    Starting with $n = 7$:
    $7 \to 22 \to 11 \to 34 \to 17 \to 52 \to 26 \to 13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1$
  </Callout>
</Callout>

### Notation

<Callout variant="notation">
  Throughout this document:
  - $\mathbb{N}$ = Natural numbers
  - $\mathbb{Z}$ = Integers
  - $\mathbb{Q}$ = Rational numbers
  - $\mathbb{R}$ = Real numbers
  - $\mathbb{C}$ = Complex numbers
</Callout>

<Callout variant="notation" title="Algorithm Complexity Notation">
  - $O(f(n))$ - Upper bound (worst case)
  - $\Omega(f(n))$ - Lower bound (best case)
  - $\Theta(f(n))$ - Tight bound (exact)
  - $o(f(n))$ - Strict upper bound
  - $\omega(f(n))$ - Strict lower bound
</Callout>

### Remark

<Callout variant="remark">
  While the proof above is correct, a more elegant approach uses the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic directly.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="remark" title="Implementation Note">
  Although the theoretical complexity is O(n log n), in practice, the constant factors make this algorithm slower than the O(n²) alternative for n < 1000.
</Callout>

### Intuition

<Callout variant="intuition">
  Think of recursion like Russian nesting dolls - each doll contains a smaller version of itself until you reach the smallest doll (base case).
</Callout>

<Callout variant="intuition" title="Why Quicksort is Fast">
  Quicksort's efficiency comes from its divide-and-conquer approach: by partitioning around a pivot, we ensure that each element is compared to the pivot only once per level of recursion. With good pivot selection, we get log n levels, giving us O(n log n) average performance.
</Callout>

### Recall

<Callout variant="recall">
  In Chapter 3, we defined a **heap** as a complete binary tree where each parent node's value is greater than or equal to its children's values (max-heap).
</Callout>

<Callout variant="recall" title="From Previous Lecture">
  We showed that:
  1. DFS uses O(h) space where h is the maximum depth
  2. BFS uses O(w) space where w is the maximum width
  3. For a balanced tree, h = O(log n) and w = O(n)
  
  Therefore, DFS is more space-efficient for balanced trees.
</Callout>

### Explanation

<Callout variant="explanation">
  The `volatile` keyword in Java prevents compiler optimizations that might cache the variable's value. This ensures that every read gets the latest value from main memory, which is crucial for multi-threaded applications.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="explanation" title="Why Immutability Matters">
  Immutable objects provide several benefits:
  
  1. **Thread Safety** - No synchronization needed
  2. **Caching** - Hash codes can be cached
  3. **Simplicity** - No defensive copying required
  4. **Debugging** - State never changes unexpectedly
  
  ```js
  // Mutable (problematic)
  const user = { name: 'Alice' };
  updateUser(user);  // What happened to user?
  
  // Immutable (clear)
  const user = { name: 'Alice' };
  const updatedUser = updateUser(user);  // Original unchanged
  ```
</Callout>

### Example

<Callout variant="example">
  Here's how to implement a singleton pattern in TypeScript:
  
  ```typescript
  class Singleton {
    private static instance: Singleton;
    
    private constructor() {}
    
    public static getInstance(): Singleton {
      if (!Singleton.instance) {
        Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
      }
      return Singleton.instance;
    }
  }
  ```
</Callout>

<Callout variant="example" title="Real-World Use Case">
  **Caching API Responses**
  
  ```javascript
  const cache = new Map();
  
  async function fetchUser(id) {
    // Check cache first
    if (cache.has(id)) {
      console.log('Cache hit!');
      return cache.get(id);
    }
    
    // Cache miss - fetch from API
    console.log('Cache miss - fetching...');
    const user = await api.getUser(id);
    cache.set(id, user);
    return user;
  }
  ```
  
  This reduces API calls and improves response times for frequently accessed data.
</Callout>

### Exercise

<Callout variant="exercise">
  Implement a function that checks if a binary tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the heights of any node's two subtrees differ by at most 1.
  
  <Callout variant="answer" defaultOpen={false}>
    ```javascript
    function isBalanced(root) {
      function checkHeight(node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        const leftHeight = checkHeight(node.left);
        if (leftHeight === -1) return -1;
        
        const rightHeight = checkHeight(node.right);
        if (rightHeight === -1) return -1;
        
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
          return -1;
        }
        
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
      }
      
      return checkHeight(root) !== -1;
    }
    ```
  </Callout>
</Callout>

### Problem

<Callout variant="problem" title="Dynamic Programming Challenge">
  Given a string s and a dictionary of words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.
  
  **Example:**
  - Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
  - Output: true
  
  **Constraints:**
  - 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 300
  - 1 ≤ wordDict.length ≤ 1000
  
  <Callout variant="solution" defaultOpen={false}>
    **Approach**: Use dynamic programming with a boolean array.
    
    ```python
    def wordBreak(s, wordDict):
        n = len(s)
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Empty string
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] and s[j:i] in wordDict:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        
        return dp[n]
    ```
    
    **Time Complexity**: O(n²) where n is the length of string s
    **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the dp array
  </Callout>
</Callout>

### Answer

<Callout variant="answer">
  The time complexity of merge sort is **O(n log n)** in all cases (best, average, and worst).
</Callout>

<Callout variant="answer" title="Quiz Solution">
  1. **True** - A complete binary tree of height h has between 2^h and 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes
  2. **False** - Hash tables have O(1) average case, but O(n) worst case
  3. **True** - Every AVL tree is a binary search tree with height-balancing property
</Callout>

### Solution

<Callout variant="solution">
  To reverse a linked list iteratively:
  
  ```python
  def reverseList(head):
      prev = None
      current = head
      
      while current:
          next_node = current.next  # Save next
          current.next = prev       # Reverse pointer
          prev = current           # Move prev forward
          current = next_node      # Move current forward
      
      return prev  # New head
  ```
  
  **Explanation**: We maintain three pointers and reverse links one by one.
</Callout>

</Callout>

## Advanced Usage

### Nested Callouts

<Callout variant="theorem" title="Master Theorem">
  For recurrences of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$ where $a \geq 1$, $b > 1$:
  
  <Callout variant="explanation">
    The Master Theorem provides a cookbook method for solving common divide-and-conquer recurrences.
  </Callout>
  
  1. If $f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon})$ for some $\epsilon > 0$, then $T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})$
  2. If $f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})$, then $T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \log n)$
  3. If $f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})$ for some $\epsilon > 0$, and $af(n/b) \leq cf(n)$ for some $c < 1$, then $T(n) = \Theta(f(n))$
  
  <Callout variant="example">
    For merge sort: $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)$
    - $a = 2, b = 2$, so $\log_b a = 1$
    - $f(n) = O(n) = O(n^1)$
    - Case 2 applies: $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$
  </Callout>
</Callout>

### Collapsible Callouts

<Callout variant="exercise">
  Write a function to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings.
  
  <Callout variant="answer" defaultOpen={false}>
    ```python
    def lcs(text1, text2):
        m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        
        return dp[m][n]
    ```
  </Callout>
