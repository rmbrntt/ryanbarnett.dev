# Quantum Components

This is an exploration of quantum-inspired UI components that blend modern design principles with quantum computing concepts.

## Quantum Cards

<QuantumCard theme="cyan">
  This is a quantum card with a cyan theme.
</QuantumCard>

<QuantumCard theme="purple">
  This is a quantum card with a purple theme.
</QuantumCard>

## Quantum Container

<QuantumContainer>
  This content is wrapped in a quantum container, inheriting the current quantum
  theme.
</QuantumContainer>{" "}
